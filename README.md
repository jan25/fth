A 2D game to pick hearts while surviving the collapsing world around you. I wrote this game for Feb 14th 2025.

## Game play

As a player(add character) you should survive the world while picking as many hearts as possible over several life times until death summons. This is an **endless game play**, only end criteria is if you give up.

You are allowed these game moves:

1. Select any empty cell to walk to.
2. Select heart to walk toward it, and pick up if you reach it.
3. Select obstacles to clear while you have explosives left.
4. Reach yellow key to start a new life and continue play.
5. Select skull key to give up.
